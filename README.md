2. Categorization of moods into predefined states (e.g., Happy, Sad, Stressed).
3. Randomized yoga pose suggestions for each mood state.
4. Scalable API endpoints for integration with front-end applications.

### Technologies Used
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Framework: Flask
3. Sentiment Analysis: nltk
4.  Sentiment Intensity Analyzer
5. Frontend: Optional integration-ready
6. Data Storage: JSON (Yoga pose mappings)
